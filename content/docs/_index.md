Welcome to the Axiom Hugo Theme documentation.

## Support

Please refer to the official [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and the [Hugo Community Discourse](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) to find answers and solutions. If you need help with something Axiom specific, please ask your question via Twitter, Stack Overflow, or - as a last resort - email.

__Please DO NOT open a Github Issue unless it is related to Axiom specific code__. Hugo error messages generally are due to improper settings in the Config file added after installation.

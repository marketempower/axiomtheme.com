Welcome to the Axiom Hugo Theme documentation.

## Support

Please refer to the official [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) and the [Hugo Community Discourse](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) to find answers and solutions. If you need help with something Axiom specific, please ask your question via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/axiomtheme), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1535514), or - as a last resort - [email](mailto:{{< param "brand.email" >}}).

__Please DO NOT open a Github Issue unless it is related to Axiom specific code__. Hugo error messages generally are due to improper settings in the Config file added after installation.

### Most Common User Error

Didn't synchronize the [Config]({{< relref "docs/configuration" >}}) file after **install** or **update**.

Custom Axiom Frontmatter fields for Hugo.

__Private__: Exclude a piece of Content from Robots indexing, Sitemaps, and Feeds.

```yaml
+++
private = true
+++
```

Useful for Pages such as 404, Privacy Policy, or Disclosures that you don't want indexed.

__Feature__: Add a Featured image to a piece of Content.

```yaml
+++
# Using path plus filename
feature = "image/uploads/file.jpg"

# Using 'public_id' (uuid), instead of filename
feature = "5e39e315-c06c-4d81-9b4a-35fca661621c"
+++
```

> Remember to output the image in the size set in the _Image_ Config (`params.image` `width` and `height`) option and store it locally or on a CDN. See the _Image_ section in the [Configuration]({{< relref "configuration" >}}) for details.

__Caption__: Add a Caption to a Featured image.

```yaml
+++
caption = "Feature image caption and image alt text."
+++
```

__Author__: Author of the Content.

```yaml
+++
# Author Id from /data/author.toml
author = "default"
+++
```

See the _Author_ section in the [Configuration]({{< relref "configuration" >}}) for details.

__Subtitle__: Short blurb enhancing the Content's _Title_. Used in the Structured Data `alternativeHeadline` field and in Content Summaries.

```yaml
+++
subtitle = "Suggested 25 words / 125 chars. Used in metadata, Post Page, and Content summaries."
+++
```

SEO potential, write something relevant.

__Summary__: Summary and Meta Description of the Content. Used in Section Pages, Summery Pages, Meta, Open-Graph, and Structured Data `description` fields. Affected by Hugo's Config variable `summaryLength` which defaults to `70`.

```yaml
+++
summary = "Summary, and meta description. Automatically generated by Hugo's 'Summary' function if not provided. Longer than Summary, with more detail, typically 70 words more or less."
+++
```

SEO potential, write something relevant.

__Comments__: Turn off Comments for this piece of Content.

```yaml
+++
comments = false
+++
```

__Max Width__: Set the max width of Page Title, Feature, and/or Content.

```yaml
+++
# Page sections
maxWidthTitle = "max-w-2xl"
maxWidthFeature = "max-w-5xl"
maxWidthContent = "max-w-2xl"

# Template parts
maxWidthHeader = "max-w-6xl"
maxWidthFooter = "max-w-6xl"
+++
```

The value for the max width param must be a valid CSS class name that is defined in Tailwind CSS or in Custom CSS.

Setting any of these will override the default max width value. Alternatively, you can set these in the [Configuration]({{< relref "configuration" >}}) file for a global change.

__Type Chromeless__: Display a Page without any "chrome", i.e., header or footer. This is useful for creating printable PDFs of a Page for download, or unwrapping a Page to `iframe` on another website.

```yaml
+++
type = "chromeless"
# Optional custom layout, otherwise uses `layouts/page/single` layout:
# layout = "custom-layout"
+++
```

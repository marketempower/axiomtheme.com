Axiom [v0.6.5](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/releases/tag/v0.6.5):

**What's New**

- Update to dedicated domain name, whoohoo! This enables us to peel-off the Docs and News from the Example Project, keeping it simple and uncluttered, while enabling Axiom to have it's own dedicated website for Docs, News, and more ([`3e4d6ba`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/3e4d6ba765db75bafc987138185821fb8b49d753))

**Maintenance**

- Remove Changelog, using Releases instead ([`f7a683f`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/f7a683f843fbc30fb6fdd6cfb32d910f3944b082))

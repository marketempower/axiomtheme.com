This [release](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/releases/tag/v0.6.9) adds new features Chromeless `type` and `layout`, Shortcodes `summary` and `page-resource`. Updates Alpine JS to latest version, and improves link colors for better accessibility.

**What's New**

- Add "chromeless" `type` and `layout`. Display a Page without any "chrome", i.e., header or footer, only the `.Content` data. This is useful for creating printable PDFs of a Page for download, or unwrapping a Page to `iframe` on another website ([`a60c34e`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/a60c34e))

Frontmatter example (toml):
```yaml
+++
type = "chromeless"
# Optional custom chromeless layout, otherwise `layouts/page/single.html` is used:
# layout = "custom-layout"
+++
```

- Add new Shortcode `summary`. Place a "summary" of a piece of Content anywhere, i.e., place a summary block of a Page you want to highlight on the Homepage. Normally, this type of summary is just for a list like Recent Posts, but this Shortcode brings it to a single piece of Content ([`52e4684`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/52e4684))

```plaintext
{{%/* summary "pages/company-event" */%}}
```

- Add new Shortcode `page-resource`. Include Page type resources from a Leaf Page Bundle and display them in Content. Similar to a `headless-resource`, but for Content specific to just the Page. A Page Leaf Bundle with a Page resource `data-table.md` could be put inline: ([`8e0a04d`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/8e0a04d))

```plaintext
{{%/* page-resource "data-table" */%}}

# Or, if it's an .html file, using the other Shortcode escapes < and >:
{{</* page-resource "data-table" */>}}
```

**Updates**

- Update Alpine JS version ([`917a5d9`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/917a5d9))
- Change link colors for better accessibility ([`aed36d7`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/aed36d7))
- Shortcode `blocks/section`: Remove margin-top default, add more customization options ([`eadcc3a`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/eadcc3a))
- Add `flex-1` class to whitelist. Make this Tailwind style available to users by default ([`66358a7`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/66358a7))

**Fixes**

- `.cdata` auto margin-top: Add override for mt-0 to allow user setting w/out !important. Since each child element of `.cdata` gets a margin-top, setting `mt-0` on an element wouldn't work due to specificity, this fixes that ([`1abb7cc`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/1abb7cc))
- Fix spelling error in translation ([`cedad41`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/cedad41))

This [release](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/releases/tag/v0.7.0) has **breaking changes** (name-spacing Google service variables), a new Shopping Cart SVG icon, and new Google Tag Manager feature.

**Breaking Changes**

- Namespace Google variables. Google variables in the `.params.services` services section were renamed. You'll need to update your Hugo *Config* file (`config.toml`) with the new names. This was something that needed to be done, and since a new "minor-major" version number was next, it was time. ([`700a3b8`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/700a3b8))

Here are the new variable names for the Google services:
```
googleAnalyticsId = ""
googleTagManagerId = ""
googleAdsId = ""
googleAdsenseId = ""
googleAdsenseAdSlotId = ""
googleAdsenseLoad = ""
googleAdsConversionId = ""
googleAdsConversionValue = 0
```

**What's New**

- Add new feature "Google Tag Manager". See the Docs Configuration Services section for usage ([`3bc8c96`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/3bc8c96))
- New shopping cart SVG icon. A custom shopping cart design by us. We'll be adding some new tools for Affiliate Marketers and this is a piece of that feature ([`3f7d7b8`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/3f7d7b8))

**Updates**

- Add CSS class `mt-9` to whitelist ([`6171852`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/6171852))
- Rename class for 3px spacing ([`9edf250`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/9edf250))

**Fixes**

- Re-work CSS style `.lead` for specificity fixes ([`2c02959`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/2c02959))
- Remove colon on variable definition ([`a0da35b`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/a0da35b))

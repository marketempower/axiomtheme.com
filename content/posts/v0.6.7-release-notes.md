This [release](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/releases/tag/v0.6.7) makes theme meta information work in any environment, specifically the themes.gohugo.io website, and changes to the default language code for better fallbacks.

**Updates**

- Make theme meta work in any environment, remove some outdated meta tags. Certain build environments were breaking, such as the themes.gohugo.io website, this update makes the code more robust ([`02c4000`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/02c40002f2a7d3c0dbf8a00c6076951d8ceb68a9))
- Simplify language files, stronger language fallbacks, change `defaultContentLanguage` to `en` from `en-us` ([`09f8bf9`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/09f8bf9b6c5c126940f1a5f80ecf2f8e901f194e), [`c69c5c2`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/c69c5c28790088768d30c125b820489c3645fd69))
- Disable Disqus comments when on localhost to prevent phantom threads ([`baaf570`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/baaf570556224b1e02a713b2065e02a0ed9f0301))

This release makes theme meta information work in any environment, specifically the themes.gohugo.io website, and changes to the default language code for better fallbacks.

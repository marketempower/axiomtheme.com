This [release](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/releases/tag/v0.7.1) features Bootstrap style Responsive Tables CSS, Russian language localization, Button Shortcode `id` attribute, and updates Alpine JS and Tailwind to latest versions.

**What's New**

- Responsive Tables. Bootstrap style responsive tables that overflow on the x-axis. Use same syntax as Bootstrap: ([`f93fbe3`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/f93fbe3))

```html
<div class="table-responsive">
  <table>
    ...
  </table>
</div>
```

- Add Russian language localization PR ([`#6`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/pull/6)) by [@dpolyakov](https://github.com/dpolyakov)

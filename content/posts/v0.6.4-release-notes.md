Axiom [v0.6.4](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/releases/tag/v0.6.4):

**What's New**

- **Disqus Comments**: Adding your Disqus comments shortname to the Config will enable comments. Comments can be turned off on a post-by-post basis. Comments are lazy loaded for performance. See the Docs Configuration `params.services` section, Frontmatter page, and Features page for details ([`c0e02aa`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/c0e02aabe12a69d6d7061b56873ff9ee1d8db438))

**Improvements**

- Remove unnecessary functions from JSON ([`9e6fcfa`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/9e6fcfa5ea9698e7f713e45978e015b1a588bb28))
- Reduce specificity on `<pre>` elements ([`016bb14`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/016bb1427fdc80aa401519ea7f4ac3ce4067e2bd))
- Remove margin on injected `<script/style>` elements ([`9ec5979`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/9ec597993816cc072409b7a8cce76522b4adc912))

This [release](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/releases/tag/v0.6.3) includes fine tuning the Hugo built-in Chroma Syntax Highlighting upgrade.

**Chroma Optimizations**

- Move remaining CSS decorations to `<pre>` from `<code>` to align with Chroma's Color Scheme format. This will allow more seamless hot swap of color schemes for user customization

**Improvements**

- Removed deprecated `work-break` CSS property

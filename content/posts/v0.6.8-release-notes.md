This [release](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/releases/tag/v0.6.8) adds user customization of Page widths, Blockquote styling improvements, CSS helper classes, outline Button style, and Adsense code bug fix.

**What's New**

- Customize Page and Template max widths! You can now specify page widths at a global or on a per page basis. This is useful if you have wider content needs for specific pages or posts. See the Docs Configuration and Frontmatter pages for more information ([`6f619b1`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/6f619b19baf71e94fccc94ce28b5d2930449bcc7)), ([`fecb45d`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/fecb45d07e964bdeb32852f3f05a066e30010c80))

- Outline Button style. Setting a Button type to `base` will display an outline style Button. See the Docs Shortcodes page for more information ([`ca9b03e`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/ca9b03ed1c91f79bf776d2ad93dcb212b3083109))

- Additional CSS additions. Use the `stretched-link` CSS class on links to fill a Card or similar component's area with a clickable link. Works the same as in Bootstrap's Cards. Use the `lead` CSS class on a paragraph element to create a Marketing style lead paragraph ([`3072746`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/307274699ff851c6a3a9bd9b4b7be899545d6f63))

**Updates**

- Add extra parameter to toggle the `cdata` class on the `blocks/section` Shortcode ([`b6a2d3b`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/b6a2d3b79af0caa5cce28a1973cae5a5a550c98f))

- Adjust Header element sizes. Slightly increase size of Header and elements inside for better mobile UX ([`72052d6`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/72052d6eaf1716aad6e2a32ddae40c647f7b79d2))

- Improvements to Blockquote CSS styling ([`48ca596`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/48ca596417af28ce564d4bba922b244e592fa4a8))

**Bug Fixes**

- Add `safeHTML` filter on Content in the `headless-resource` Shortcode ([`4d491d2`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/4d491d2774d8a1ff188a88421ac8ba5aae6d082c))

- Fix Adsense code, rename load style variable. Fix issue where the `adsenseId` was not being output to snippet. Rename the Configuration Services parameter `adsenseLazy` to `adsenseLoad` to allow more loading options. See the Docs Configuration Services section and Features page for more information ([`c7c060c`](https://github.com/marketempower/axiom/commit/c7c060c45b89ca3debde020fd74ded6a9b6cecab))
